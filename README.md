# Tic Tac Toe Game in React

A simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using React, HTML, CSS, and JS. It allows two players to take turns marking squares on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## How it works
- Each player takes turns clicking on an empty square to mark it with their symbol (X or O).
- The game ends when one player aligns three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when all squares are filled without a winner (draw).

## Features:
- Two players can play against each other.
- Indicates the winner when the game is won.
- Allows players to go back to previous moves throughout the game.
- Records and displays the move history.
